                Gender equality makes development stronger and more sustainable. It is not only a pressing moral and social issue but also a critical economic challenge. If women—who account for half the world's working-age population—do not achieve their full economic potential, the global economy will suffer.In order to achieve gender equality, it is necessary to build a society in which women and men share equally in the distribution of power and influence and have equal access to education, health, decent work and livelihoods.

            <p>
                Being in a community gives women a voice when they may not have had one before. Breaking down barriers in collaborative communities will create change and help communities lobby for the change we need to see in the world. We must be there for one another and advocate for each other.These communities are where women can go to at any time to feel safer and empowered, and have access to information, education, recreational activities, support, and integrated services.
